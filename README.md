# Course Score
Course Score plugin for SportTracks (Desktop) 

This software was open-sourced after SportTracks desktop was discontinued, and all restrictions have been removed.

Using Course Score, you can easily compare your favorite climbs to previous attempts.  It also generates a running or cycling score so you can quantify the difficulty of your favorite courses.

### Overview
- The **Overall** view for the plugin will give you basic statistics on the current course. 
- You can click the triangle next to *Course Score* to flip between the cycling and running scores.

### Individual climb details
- You can flip to Details to view data for each hill found.  If you click the color wheel in the chart, it will color the hills based on your criteria.  In the screenshot below, hills are colored based on difficulty.  The hardest climb is the darkest and the other climbs are a percentage it's difficulty.
- If you climb the same hills multiple times in an activity, the matching hills should have the same 'Hill id'.

### How to compare climbs
If you right-click on a climb, you can choose 2 options:
- Find the hill based on the same GPS coordinates
- Find hills like this hill based on elevation gained and distance covered.

- Once you have found matching hills, you can ctrl+click on each hill to compare it in the graph below. 
- When you compare more than one hill, each hill's data will color based on that hill's id.
